## my dotfiles!

I use [gnu stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage to my dotfiles

I find it very easy and simple to use for basic dotfile setup

### setup instructions

clone this repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rogue-87/dotfiles.git
```

then use `make` to run stow. here's what you can do

```sh
# setup dotfiles
just stow
# remove dotfiles
just unstow
```

tada!, you're good to go :]
